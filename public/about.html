<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am now sixty-one years old and have been working in IT since October 1989! The world of IT was much different
  then. I began as a Dataflex Developer for the Home Office in the UK.
  It was a standard for the department and also used by the Prison Service.</p>
  
  <p>In 1994 the in-house bid of the IT department (ED5) failed and we were
  outsourced to Sema Group and lost 33% of the staff. The early working with this outfit was very stressful and I was getting nowhere and
  tarred with a brush of a failing project. As I couldn't make any headway, when a colleague spotted a job that sounded just like me in Computer Weekly for 
  First Choice Ski in Brighton, I applied for it even though it was on the South Coast.</p>

<p>I got the job and moved down with the family. It was a very interesting and enjoyable job and we loved it there.
  However, certain things I was promised at the interview failed to materialise. I had been in touch contantly with my old job and
  had been offered the chance to return. Mrs brown said she wanted to go back home so we returned to the same house in Formby.</p>

<p>I came back and worked on Prison Service and Home Office systems very successfully. However both contracts were up for renewal 
  and there was competition. Sema was now Schlumberger Sema after a buyout and they lost both contract renewals. I was told that 
  I would be retained by Schlumberger Sema and couldn't join either of the new undertakings. I couldn't take the risk which others
  did of forcing their way in as I was the sole wage earner. So I remained and worked on the last project that was running in the 
  Liverpool Office. This was The Strategic Tracing Service fgor the NHS and when I joined it the project was in terrible trouble. 
  I was the Data Manager and managed to turn things around battling some terrible management and doing ridiculous hours 6 or 7 days 
  a week. We ended up with the Gold Standard Database. However, the National programme for IT for the NHS had just been announced and 
  I was asked into a meeting room to be told that the third phase of the project had been cancelled and that I had to work with BT 
  to trasfer this Gold Standard database and its workings to them as we were giving it away in the hope we won one of these massive
  contracts.

    Yet another however here - Schlumberger Seam were being bought by Atos Origin and when they looked at these Local Service Provider 
    contracts thought it way too risky as they were PFIs and so pulled out. So we had given away this Tracing Service for nothing and 
    got nothing for it apart from some consultancy for around 6 years because BT made such a mess. But this wasn't a project so I had 
    to find another assignment and that was the last project they would have in Liverpool.

  <p>
    So I ended up in London for nearly four years working on the Genesis Programme for DEFRA as the Reference Data Manager. This was 
    a massive project with over 300 people on it with overlapping releases and bunker mentalities. We made it work but this could have
    been done much more simply with about half the people if it had been driven by when components were deliverable. But it was much
    better than the Accenture system for Single Farm Payments so was seen as a big success. It really raised my profile.

    It was suggested that I neede to work back up North for a break so joined an Atos Healthcare project to review the collapsing 
    integrated systems. It was a complete mess and terrible atmosphere to work in. The Systems Integration hit squad were called in and 
    I was seen as surplus to requirements so ended up back on Genesis in London for nine months.

    I had applied to go through clearance for FCO work and have been on this ever since
